# Covid-simulator

In the middle of the pandemic, run a NetLogo simulator of how the virus behaves in a population that only go to a supermarket.

In order to create the simulator, we tried to take real data on the spread of the virus, hospitalisations, age ranges most affected, supermarkets's capacity, etc.

Different cases were simulated where the government takes different laws to control the virus, in order to study which would be the best solution.
